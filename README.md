### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I go by Torque (/tÉ”É¹k/) and I am a senior at MIT interested in hardware, computational photography, quantum computing and math. I spent the past year doing research on diamond-based quantum computing, making simulators for superconductors and developing glasses that filter out epileptic triggers with a team of product designers. Outside of research and classes, you can find me designing my own microcontroller, going on hikes or practicing the ukulele.
