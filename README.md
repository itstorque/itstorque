### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!


Hey there! I go by Torque /tÉ”É¹k/ and I'm a researcher at Microsoft Quantum working on various theory and readout aspects of building a topological quantum computer and AI/ML methods that are involved in doing so. 

In my free time, you can find me working on random things including: nueral network architectures and ML theory, hardware, symbolic programming, superconducting electronics, computational photography, computational geometry and probability theory. I enjoy reducing problems into math, designing things (physical or theoretic :)) to be optimal and hacking functionality into existing software. Check out my blog to get a glimpse of my projects [itstorque.com/blog](https://www.itstorque.com/blog).
